# Experiments in fair politics

The goal of these projects is to implement novel algorithms for fair elections and fairly dividing public resources, and test the algorithms on real data elicited using opinion polls. The topics are:

1. Fair allocation of budget: https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3328526.3329557 and https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/20421 and .

2. Fair committee election: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional_approval_voting and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phragmen%27s_voting_rules .
