# Experiments in fair politics

The goal of these projects is to implement novel algorithms for fair elections and fairly dividing public resources, and test the algorithms on real data elicited using opinion polls. The topics are:

1. Fair allocation of budget; see https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3328526.3329557 and https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/20421 .

2. Fair election to knesset; see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional_approval_voting  and https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3465456.3467641 .

3. Fair primary elections; see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phragmen%27s_voting_rules .

4. Fair deteremination of schedule for politicians; see https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.08043 .

5. Developing and implementing a cryptographic voting system (requires a course in cryptography).
