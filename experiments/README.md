# Experiments in fair politics

The goal of these projects is to implement novel algorithms for fair elections and fairly dividing public resources, and test the algorithms on real data elicited using opinion polls. The topics are:

1. Fair allocation of budget: https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3328526.3329557 and https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/20421 and .

2. Fair election to knesset: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional_approval_voting  and https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3465456.3467641 .

3. Fair primary elections: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phragmen%27s_voting_rules .

4. Fair deteremination of schedule for politicians: https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.08043 .

5. Developing and implementing a cryptographic voting system (requires a course in cryptography).
