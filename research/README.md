# Developing a new algorithm

In this project, you will develop an entirely new algorithm, for solving a new problem. This sounds scary, but you will not be alone - we will develop the algorithm together, step after step. At the end, you will publish a paper describing your algorithm, and (if you want and the paper is accepted) present it in an international conference.
The algorithms I work on are related to fair division:

1. Fair random assignment of tasks, taking into account the previous assignments.

2. Allocation of items, that is egalitarian up to at most one item.

3. Fair media: automatic detection of bias in newspapers (requires knowledge in NLP and machine learning).
