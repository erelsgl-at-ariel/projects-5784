# Open-source projects - Time Table

There are 10 milestones. The grade for each milestone is 5%:

1. Find an open-source library, initiate a discussion with the developers to make sure they want your contribution. Due by 15/10/23.

2. Choose a paper and summarize it in your own words; see details [here](https://github.com/erelsgl-at-ariel/research-5783/blob/main/02-research-start/homework.pdf). Due by 15/11/23.

3. Create detailed running examples; see details [here](https://github.com/erelsgl-at-ariel/research-5783/blob/main/04-research-examples/homework.pdf). Due by 15/12/23.

4. Fork and clone; write headers and unit-tests. See details [here](https://github.com/erelsgl-at-ariel/research-5783/blob/main/06-python-development/homework.pdf). Due by 15/1/24.

5. Write a complete implementation of the algorithm. Be sure to test it thoroughly. See details [here](https://github.com/erelsgl-at-ariel/research-5783/blob/main/08-research-implementation/homework.pdf). Due by 15/2/24.

6. Compare algorithm performance to existing algorithms. Due by 15/3/24.
