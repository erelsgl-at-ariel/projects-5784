# Open-source projects - Time Table

There are 5 milestones. The grade for each milestone is 10%:

1. Choose a paper, summarize it and create running examples. See details [here](https://github.com/erelsgl-at-ariel/research-5783/blob/main/02-research-start/homework.pdf) and [here](https://github.com/erelsgl-at-ariel/research-5783/blob/main/04-research-examples/homework.pdf) (ignore the grades written there). Due by 15/10/23.
2. Find an open-source library, initiate a discussion with the developers to make sure they want your contribution; write headers and unit-tests. See details [here](https://github.com/erelsgl-at-ariel/research-5783/blob/main/06-python-development/homework.pdf). Due by 15/12/23.
3. Write a complete implementation of the algorithm. Be sure to test it thoroughly. See details [here](https://github.com/erelsgl-at-ariel/research-5783/blob/main/08-research-implementation/homework.pdf). Due by 15/2/24.
4. Improve the performance of the algorithm, and compare to performance of existing algorithms. See details [here](https://github.com/erelsgl-at-ariel/research-5783/blob/main/10-python-performance/homework.pdf). Due by 15/4/24.
5. Write a report summarizing your experiments. Due by 15/6/24.
6. BONUS: Submit a pull-request to the library. See details [here](https://github.com/erelsgl-at-ariel/research-5783/blob/main/12-python-publishing/homework.pdf). OR: Write a website for demonstrating your algorithm. See details [here](https://github.com/erelsgl-at-ariel/research-5783/blob/main/11-python-web/homework.pdf).


The rest of the grade will be determined as follows:
* 20% by the project coordinator (Or Anidjar);
* 15% by Boaz Ben-Moshe;
* 15% by Amit Dvir.
Their grade will be based on the poster, the oral examination, the report and the code.
