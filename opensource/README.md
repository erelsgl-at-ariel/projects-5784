# Implementing algorithms for open-source projects

In these projects, you will implement novel algorithms from research papers, compare their performance in simulations, and integrate them into open-source projects. Why is it good for you?

1. During your studies, you solve tasks where you write new code. But in work, you will probably need to integrate into existing code, which is much more complex. Contributing to an open-source system gives you a chance to practice this important skill.
2. Open-source systems are managed by veteran experienced programmers. Contributing to such  systems lets you work with these programmers and learn from their experience.
3. The code you write in these projects will be actually used by many people around the world.
4. Your name will appear as contributors to the system; this will substantially contribute to your CV.
