# Educational computer game

In these projects, you will develop a computer game that can  be used for education or research.
The projects are based on a course in game development, which was given in the CS department in previous years. You can get the course materials from 5783 [here](https://github.com/gamedev-at-ariel/gamedev-5783), and the recordings from 5782 [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLM9fKcsATjxjqsyIcU4IRWuo-w4rQf_Pb).

For game ideas and subjects, see [here](https://github.com/erelsgl-at-ariel/projects-5783/tree/main/games).

See [timetable](timetable.md).
